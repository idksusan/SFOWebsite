          <h1>About our club</h1>
        </div>
          <P>The Student Film Organization meets every Thursday from 7 PM to 8 PM, usually in 110 Sackett. Our activities vary from meeting to meeting, but everything is always done in the interest of spreading love for film all across campus and bringing the spotlight to the film community here in State College. Examples of things we've done in the past include short film competitions (such as the 4-Day Film Fest), workshops on various film techniques, outings to nearby screenings, and fun film-related games.</P>

          <h2><b>President:</b> Taylor Myers</h2>
          <p>Taylor is a senior film-video student whose interests in film include screenwriting, hopefully for TV/comedies, and possibly producing one day. Her other hobbies besides writing include music (struggling to play guitar), reading, and going to parks and hoping someoneâ€™s dog comes up to her so she can pet it.</p>

          <h2><b>Vice President:</b> Alan Shimp</h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is Alan G. Shimp. I like to put the "G." in there because it makes me sound important. I'm a history major with a film studies minor, which, because of the way the history major works, basically adds up to be a film history degree. Credential-wise, I'm an award-winning filmmaker, a certified genius, the world's foremost expert on classic films, the future ruler of the multiverse, winner of the "world's largest ego" contest three years running, and so cool that my paragraph is in first-person. At least one of those things I said isn't true (HINT: It's the "foremost expert on classic films" one - I've watched more than a thousand movies, but I'm not THAT great). Also, I'm writing a book about film with my dad. It's pretty cool, so as soon as we come up with a title and get it published, you should check it out. Shameless self-promotion's hard when the thing isn't finished.</p>

          <h2><b>Treasurer:</b> Peter Rivera</h2>
          <p>My name is Peter Rivera. I'm currently a Schreyer Honors Scholar at The Pennsylvania State University, Class of 2019. I'm in the Smeal College of Business for Business Management and intend to double-major in the College of Communications for Film-Video.
          After graduating from The Pennylvania State University, I plan to combine the knowledge gained from my two degrees to pursue an occupation as a producer and a screenwriter. I aspire to be a showrunner and retain complete creative control over any of my own content. One day, I hope to establish my own film production company.</p>

          <h2><b>Webmaster:</b> Nick Sivak</h2>
          <p>Nick Sivak is a Sophomore. He is aspiring to be in the Film and Video Production major at Penn State University. Nick is your all around nerd, loving all things video game and movie. Nick likes spending time editing together short videos of his friends, so it would be a natural fit for him to find a career in film post production later in life.</p>
